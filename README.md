# ESPDMX
The ESPDMX combines the ESP32 microcontroller with the DMX protocol into one easy-to-use, complete development board. Able to both send and receive DMX signals, it's the perfect way to start developing your own fixtures and controllers. This board's DMX power and data are optically isolated to meet DMX512 standards, helping provide smooth operation for inline equipment. Designed for the theatrical hobbyist, it's never been easier to integrate your projects with the rest of your control system!
